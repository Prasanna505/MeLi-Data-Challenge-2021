#The Challenge

Build a model to forecast item inventory days based on Mercado Libre historical data.<br>
Every day, Mercadolibre's shipping unit (MercadoEnv√≠os) delivers thousands of products across Latin America.<br>

In order to provide customers with the best experience throughout the shipping process, it is critical to have accurate sales forecasts.<br>

At the core of this business problem, lies the Data Challenge task: given the historical sales time-series for a subset of the martketplace's listings, we challenge you to predict how long will it take for a given item to run out of stock.<br>
